# PalmPal ðŸŒ´ðŸ¤–

PalmPal is a recommendation project, where we create a chatbot. This chatbot is created using the open-source Llama 3 LLM model from Meta.

Particularly, we're using the [**Llama2-7B**](https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama7b-v2-chat) model deployed by the Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) team and hosted on the [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) platform.

This app was refactored from [a16z's implementation](https://github.com/a16z-infra/llama2-chatbot) of their [LLaMA2 Chatbot](https://www.llama2.ai/) to be light-weight for deployment to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
